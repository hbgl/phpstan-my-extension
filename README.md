# My PHPStan extension starter pack

## Support for non-PhpStorm IDEs like VS Code

This project will install [phpstan/phpstan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) and extract the source code from the `vendor/phpstan/phpstan/phpstan.phar/src` into the directory `.ideincludes`. The directory `.ideincludes` can then be included into your IDE for autocompletion and type hinting.
